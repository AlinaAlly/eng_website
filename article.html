                <p><strong>What is Computer Programming?</strong></p>
                <p>I never planned to work in tech; after studying journalism, I was all set for a career as a foreign correspondent for a print newspaper. Sadly, I graduated at the peak of the economic crisis, and the severe decline in print media.</p>

                <p>So, after shedding a few tears, I landed a job at a publishing company that specializes in B2B tech. At the time, it was trying to establish a strong online news presence and needed a journalist with basic computer programming skills. While I didn’t know how to code at the time, I gladly stepped up to the plate. I adored learning and loved problem-solving, so computer programming seemed like the perfect fit.</p>

                <p>The first thing I had to do was work out exactly what computer programming involved, and how I was going to teach myself how to code. After many hours of research, and help from friends and family in the industry, I finally started to get enough of a handle on it to be able to explain it to other newbies. So here I am, ready to share my newfound knowledge with fellow learners!</p>
