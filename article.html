                <p><strong>What is Computer Programming?</strong></p>
                <p>I never planned to work in tech; after studying journalism, I was all set for a career as a foreign correspondent for a print newspaper. Sadly, I graduated at the peak of the economic crisis, and the severe decline in print media.</p>

                <p>So, after shedding a few tears, I landed a job at a publishing company that specializes in B2B tech. At the time, it was trying to establish a strong online news presence and needed a journalist with basic computer programming skills. While I didn’t know how to code at the time, I gladly stepped up to the plate. I adored learning and loved problem-solving, so computer programming seemed like the perfect fit.</p>

                <p>The first thing I had to do was work out exactly what computer programming involved, and how I was going to teach myself how to code. After many hours of research, and help from friends and family in the industry, I finally started to get enough of a handle on it to be able to explain it to other newbies. So here I am, ready to share my newfound knowledge with fellow learners!</p>
                <p> Computer programming is a way of giving computers instructions about what they should do next. These instructions are known as code, and computer programmers write code to solve problems or perform a task. </p>
                <p> The end goal is to create something: that could mean anything from a web page, or a piece of software, or even just a pretty picture. That‘s why computer programming is often described as a mix between art and science; it‘s technical and analytical, yet creative at the same time. </p>
                <p> When I first started looking for courses to teach myself how to code, I realized just how much I didn‘t know. My brothers work as programmers, so I‘d seen the lines and lines of symbols and letters they wrote, but I had no idea what they all meant. I didn‘t even know how what I saw on my screen when I was carrying out simple tasks such as shopping online or browsing social media related to these mystical languages. </p>
                <p> I researched the subject thoroughly, but most of the articles I read were full of technical jargon that I didn‘t understand. In what is a pretty common problem in the B2B tech world, I couldn‘t find anything that explained it clearly and simply. </p>
                <p> The definition above is my attempt—as a journalist first and techie second—at explaining exactly what it is, as simply as possible. </p>
